# rust

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test rust` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## TODO

- [ ] Generate scaffolding for web and client
- [ ] Builder for calling cargo directly - maybe with a rust call (maybe use neon or webassembly)
